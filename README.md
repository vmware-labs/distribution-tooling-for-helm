# Distribution Tooling for Helm

`dt`, is a set of utilities available in a standalone mode and as a Helm Plugin for making offline work with Helm charts easier. It is meant to be used for creating reproducible and relocatable packages for Helm charts that can be easily moved across registries without hassles. This is particularly useful for distributing Helm charts into air-gapped environments like those used by Federal governments.

This tool builds on [HIP-15](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/main/hips/hip-0015.md) and the, currently proposed, [images lock file HIP (PR)](https://github.com/helm/community/pull/281) as a foundation. Hence, it does require Helm charts to contain an annotation that provides the full list of container images that a Helm chart might need for its usage independently of the bootstrapping configuration. 

[Bitnami Helm charts](https://github.com/bitnami/charts) are now fully annotated to support this tooling, but you can also use this set of utilities with any other Helm charts that might use any other alternative image listing annotation, like for example, Helm charts relying on [artifact.io/images](https://artifacthub.io/docs/topics/annotations/helm/).

## Installation

### Installing as a Helm plugin

Provided you have [Helm](https://helm.sh) then you can install this tool as a plugin:

```sh
helm plugin install https://github.com/vmware-labs/distribution-tooling-for-helm
```

### Downloading and using standalone

Fetch the latest available release from the [Releases](https://github.com/vmware-labs/distribution-tooling-for-helm/releases) section.

Note that all the examples below use this tool as a Helm plugin but you can just run it as standalone. Just remove the `helm` command from all those examples.

### Building from Source

You can build this tool with the following command. Golang 1.20 or above is needed to compile. [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/) is used for linting.

```sh
make build
```

You can also verify the build by running the unit tests:

```sh
make test
```

## Basic Usage

The following sections list the most common commands and their usage. This tool can be used either standalone or through the Helm plugin. 

For the sake of following this guide, let's pull one of the Bitnami Helm charts into an examples folder:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:vmware-labs/distribution-tooling-for-helm.git
cd distribution-tooling-for-helm
bash -c "mkdir examples & helm pull oci://docker.io/bitnamicharts/mariadb -d examples --untar" 
```

The two simplest and most powerful commands on this tool are `wrap` and `unwrap`. With these two commands **you can relocate any Helm chart to any OCI registry in two steps**. 

### Wrapping Helm charts

Wrapping a chart consists of packaging the chart into a tar.gz, including all container images that this chart depends on, independently of values. Everything gets wrapped together into a single file. This will include also all the subcharts and their container images. That new file, the wrap, can be distributed around in whatever way you want (e.g. USB stick) to then later be unwrapped into a destination OCI registry. This process is commonly referred to as relocating a Helm chart.

Even more exciting, we don't need to download the Helm chart for wrapping it. We can point the tool to any reachable Helm chart and the tool will take care of packaging and downloading everything for us. For example:

```sh
helm dt wrap oci://docker.io/bitnamicharts/kibana

 ¬ª  Wrapping Helm chart "oci://docker.io/bitnamicharts/kibana"
    ‚úî  Helm chart downloaded to "/var/folders/mn/j41xvgsx7l90_hn0hlwj9p180000gp/T/chart-1177363375/chart-1516625348/kibana"
    ‚úî  Images.lock file "/var/folders/mn/j41xvgsx7l90_hn0hlwj9p180000gp/T/chart-1177363375/chart-1516625348/kibana/Images.lock" does not exist
    ‚úî  Images.lock file written to "/var/folders/mn/j41xvgsx7l90_hn0hlwj9p180000gp/T/chart-1177363375/chart-1516625348/kibana/Images.lock"
    ¬ª  Pulling images into "/var/folders/mn/j41xvgsx7l90_hn0hlwj9p180000gp/T/chart-1177363375/chart-1516625348/kibana/images"
       ‚úî  All images pulled successfully
    ‚úî  Helm chart wrapped to "/Users/martinpe/workspace/imagelock/kibana-10.4.8.wrap.tgz"
 üéâ  Helm chart wrapped into "/Users/martinpe/workspace/imagelock/kibana-10.4.8.wrap.tgz"
```

Note that depending on the number of images needed by the Helm chart (remember, a wrap has the full set of image dependencies, not only the ones set on _values.yaml_) the size of the generated wrap might be considerably large:

```sh
ls -l kibana-10.4.8.wrap.tgz

-rw-r--r--  1 martinpe  staff  731200979 Aug  4 15:17 kibana-10.4.8.wrap.tgz
```

If you want to make changes on the Helm chart, you can and pass a directory to the wrap command. For example, if we wanted to wrap the previously pulled mariadb Helm chart, we could just do:

```sh
helm dt wrap examples/mariadb/

 ¬ª  Wrapping Helm chart "examples/mariadb/"
    ‚úî  Images.lock file "/Users/martinpe/workspace/distribution-tooling-for-helm/examples/mariadb/Images.lock" does not exist
    ‚úî  Images.lock file written to "/Users/martinpe/workspace/distribution-tooling-for-helm/examples/mariadb/Images.lock"
    ¬ª  Pulling images into "/Users/martinpe/workspace/distribution-tooling-for-helm/examples/mariadb/images"
       ‚úî  All images pulled successfully
    ‚úî  Helm chart wrapped to "/Users/martinpe/workspace/distribution-tooling-for-helm/mariadb-13.0.0.wrap.tgz"
 üéâ  Helm chart wrapped into "/Users/martinpe/workspace/distribution-tooling-for-helm/mariadb-13.0.0.wrap.tgz"
```

### Unwrapping Helm charts

Unwrapping a Helm chart can be done either to a local folder or to a target OCI registry, being the latter the most powerful option. By unwrapping the Helm chart to a target OCI registry the `dt` tool will unwrap the wrapped file, proceed to push the container images into the target registry that you have specified, relocate the references from the Helm chart to the provided registry and finally push the relocated Helm chart to the registry as well. 

At that moment your Helm chart will be ready to be used from the target registry without any dependencies to the source. By default, the tool will run in dry-run mode and require you to confirm actions but you can speed everything up with the `--yes` parameter.

```sh
helm dt unwrap kibana-10.4.8.wrap.tgz demo.goharbor.io/helm-plugin/ --yes
 ¬ª  Unwrapping Helm chart "kibana-10.4.8.wrap.tgz"
    ‚úî  Helm chart uncompressed to "/var/folders/mn/j41xvgsx7l90_hn0hlwj9p180000gp/T/chart-586072428/at-wrap2428431258"
    ‚úî  Helm chart relocated successfully
    ¬ª  The wrap includes the following 2 images:

       demo.goharbor.io/helm-plugin/bitnami/kibana:8.9.0-debian-11-r9
       demo.goharbor.io/helm-plugin/bitnami/os-shell:11-debian-11-r25

## Advanced Usage

That was all as per the basic most basic and powerful usage. If you're interested in some other additional goodies then we will dig next into some specific finer-grained commands. 

### Creating an images lock

An images lock file, a.k.a. `Images.lock` is a new file that gets created inside the directory as per [this HIP submission](https://github.com/helm/community/pull/281) to Helm community. The `Images.lock` file contains the list of all the container images annotated within a Helm chart's `Chart.yaml` manifest, including also all the images from its subchart dependencies. Along with the images, some other metadata useful for automating processing and relocation is also added.

So, for example, the mariadb Helm chart that we downloaded earlier, has an `images` annotation like this:

```yaml
cat examples/mariadb/Chart.yaml | head -n 10

annotations:
    category: Database
    images: |
        - image: docker.io/bitnami/mariadb:11.0.2-debian-11-r2
          name: mariadb
        - image: docker.io/bitnami/mysqld-exporter:0.15.0-debian-11-r5
          name: mysqld-exporter
        - image: docker.io/bitnami/os-shell:11-debian-11-r22
          name: os-shell
    licenses: Apache-2.0
```
We can run the following command to create the `Images.lock` for the above Helm chart:

```sh
helm dt images lock examples/mariadb

INFO[0005] Images.lock file written to "/Users/martinpe/workspace/distribution-tooling-for-helm/examples/mariadb/Images.lock"
```

And it should look similar to this:

```sh
cat examples/mariadb/Images.lock
```

```yaml
apiversion: v0
kind: ImagesLock

        arch: linux/arm64
```

By default `Images.lock` creation expects an `images` annotation in your Helm chart. However, this can be overridden by the `annotations-key` flag. This is useful for example when dealing with Helm charts that rely on a different annotation like `artifacthub.io/images` which has existed for a while. You can use this flag with most of the commands in this guide.

```sh
helm dt images lock ../charts/jenkins --annotations-key artifacthub.io/images
```

### Targetting specific architectures

The above `lock` command can be constrained to specific architectures. This is pretty useful to create lighter wraps as many of the images will be dropped when wrapping.

```sh
helm dt images lock ../charts/jenkins --platform linux/amd64
```

If we now look at generated `Images.lock` we will notice that it contains only `linux/amd64` digests:

```yaml
apiversion: v0
kind: ImagesLock
metadata:
  generatedAt: "2023-08-04T14:24:18.515082Z"
  generatedBy: Distribution Tooling for Helm

        arch: linux/amd64
  - name: mysqld-exporter
    image: docker.io/bitnami/mysqld-exporter:0.15.0-debian-11-r5
    chart: mariadb
    digests:
      - digest: sha256:6f257cc719f5bbde118c15ad610dc27d773f80216adabf10e315fbcaff078615
        arch: linux/amd64
  - name: os-shell
    image: docker.io/bitnami/os-shell:11-debian-11-r22
    chart: mariadb
    digests:
      - digest: sha256:7082ebf5644cf4968ac635986ded132dd308c0b9c13138f093834f343cd47d7b
        arch: linux/amd64
```

### Verifying an images lock

The `verify` command can be used to validate the integrity of an `Images.lock` file in a given Helm chart. This command will try to validate that all upstream container images that will be pulled from the Helm chart match actually the image digests that exist in the actual lock file.

With this command, you can make sure that when you distribute a Helm chart with its corresponding `Images.lock` then any customer will be able to validate that just exactly the images defined in the lock will be pulled. Note that this is exactly part of what the `unwrap` command does, to make sure that only exactly what was wrapped gets into the target registry. Signing and other types of provenance are out of the scope of this tool for the time being and need to be added manually with external tooling. This is an area that we are very eager to improve soon.

```sh
helm dt images verify examples/mariadb

INFO[0004] Helm chart "examples/mariadb" lock is valid
```

### Pulling Helm chart images

Based on the `Images.lock` file, this command downloads all listed images into the `images/` subfolder.

```sh
helm dt images pull examples/mariadb

INFO[0000] Pulling images into "/Users/martinpe/workspace/distribution-tooling-for-helm/examples/mariadb/images"
INFO[0022] All images pulled successfully
INFO[0022] Success
```

Then, in the `images` folder we should have something like

```sh
ls -1 examples/mariadb/images

232ca2da59e508978543c8b113675c239a581938c88cbfa1ff17e9b6e504dc1a.tar

7082ebf5644cf4968ac635986ded132dd308c0b9c13138f093834f343cd47d7b.tar
d3006a4d980d82a28f433ae7af316c698738ba29a5a598d527751cb9139ab7ff.tar
e0c141706fd1ce9ec5276627ae53994343ec2719aba606c1dc228f9290698fc1.tar
```

### Relocating a chart

This command will relocate a Helm chart rewriting the `Images.lock` and all of its subchart dependencies locks as well. Additionally, it will change the `Chart.yaml` annotations, and any images used inside `values.yaml` (and all those on subchart dependencies as well).

For example 

```sh
helm dt charts relocate examples/mariadb acme.com/federal
INFO[0000] Helm chart relocated successfully
```

And we can check that references have indeed changed:

```sh
cat examples/mariadb/Images.lock |grep image

images:
    image: acme.com/federal/bitnami/mariadb:11.0.2-debian-11-r2
    image: acme.com/federal/bitnami/mysqld-exporter:0.15.0-debian-11-r5
    image: acme.com/federal/bitnami/os-shell:11-debian-11-r22
```

### Pushing images

Based on the `Images.lock` file, this command pushes all images (that must have been previously pulled into the `images/` folder) into their respective registries. Note that this command does not relocate anything. It will just simply try to push the images to wherever they are pointing to. 

Obviously, this command only makes sense when used after having pulled the images and executed the `relocate` command.

```sh
# .. should have pulled images first ..
# .. then relocate to a target registry ..
# and now...
helm dt images push examples/mariadb

INFO[0033] All images pushed successfully
```

### Annotating a chart (EXPERIMENTAL)

`Images.lock` creation relies on the existence of the special images annotation inside `Chart.yaml`. If you have a Helm chart that does not contain any annotations, this command can be used to guess and generate an annotation with a tentative list of images. It's important to note that this list is a **best-effort** as the list of images is obtained from the `values.yaml` file and this is always an unreliable, often incomplete, and error-prone source as the configuration in `values.yaml` is very variable.

```sh
helm dt chart annotate examples/mariadb

INFO[0000] Helm chart annotated successfully
```
